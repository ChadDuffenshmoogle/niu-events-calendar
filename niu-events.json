This penetrating and transformative photography exhibition draws from 12 years of work created by grant winners and finalists from The Aftermath Project, a nonprofit organization committed to telling the other half of war stories, after the conflicts have ended — what it takes for individuals to rebuild destroyed lives and homes, to restore civil societies and to address the lingering wounds of war while struggling to create new avenues for peace. This exhibition is a program of ExhibitsUSA, a national division of Mid-America Arts Alliance and The National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nImage credit: \"Sara Terry, Goldfish for sale…\" , Capljina, Bosnia, March 30, 2004; digital print on aluminum, 14 7/16 x 22 inches; Courtesy of the artist.",

Using the Burma Art Collection at NIU to explore these issues, this exhibition examines and questions the changing narratives that objects undergo as their life extends beyond a generation. From the once venerated elephant ivory carvings to the once forbidden modern protest paintings, Legacies on Display interrogates how meanings and interpretations are created, changed and left behind as part of our human record.\n\nStandard museum opening hours are:\n10 a.m. - 1 p.m. Wednesday\nNoon - 6 p.m. Thursday, Friday\nNoon - 3 p.m. Saturday\n\nFor more details visit niu.edu/artmuseum",

      "description": "Civic Leadership Academy Online Course\n\nDo We Need a Plan? Selecting the Right Plan and What to Expect from the Process\n\nFebruary 19, 2026  9-11:30 a.m.\n\nAn online webinar presented by Mim Evans., MS, Senior Research Associate, Center for Governmental Studies, Northern Illinois University.\n\nDescription: Sometimes communities find themselves faced with a pressing issue or an intriguing opportunity that they are not quite prepared to address. Or perhaps the general direction of the community’s future has become a topic of discussion. In these moments, the call for “a plan” emerges, no matter the community’s size, location or length of time since the last plan. Plans are an energizing process. They provide forums to exchange ideas and set future direction and priorities. But what kind of plan? Deciding whether a formal plan is necessary and, if so, what kind of plan it should be, can be challenging.\n\n\nThis class will present an overview of different kinds of plans often considered by local governments with the goal of aiding local staff and officials in deciding what plan to pursue. Additionally, what to expect from the planning process will be discussed. Examples of completed plans and statutory requirements will be presented. Types of plans covered will include comprehensive plans, strategic plans, economic development strategies, age-friendly plans, housing studies, and master plans focused on specific topics such as the arts, parks, or downtown.\n\nObjectives:\n\nParticipants will learn the purpose and content of different kinds of plans.Participants will understand the role of local staff, officials and a potential outside consultant.Participants will learn what to expect from the planning process including who may be involved, public participation, and communication.Participants will consider what happens after the plan is complete, including community expectations and implementation.\n Addresses ICMA Practice Areas\n\n2. Community Engagement\n7. Strategic Planning\n8. Policy Facilitation and Implementation\n14. Communication and Information Sharing\n\n \n\nRegister at: https://registeruo.niu.edu/Ungerboeck_Public/emc00/register.aspx?aat=506472436f7873754f7949456f51506a78516c69316c6961554552516a68656d5765304f5173514c62714d3d\n\nHave questions?
